# FileReadUsingAwsLambda

S3 Trigger-Based File Reading
Use case: When a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket.

How it works:
Create an S3 bucket.

Upload a file to it.

Set up a Lambda function to be triggered on S3 events (like s3:ObjectCreated:*).

Lambda will receive the file path (bucket name + key) in the event.

Inside Lambda, read the file from S3.

Process content and create output (e.g., transform data, extract text, etc.).

Typical Outputs:

Store processed results back into another S3 bucket.

Send output to DynamoDB, SNS, or SQS.

Log results in CloudWatch.

ðŸ”¹ 2. API Gateway + Lambda (On-Demand Read)
Use case: User sends a request with a filename or path to read the file.

How it works:
API Gateway is configured with a Lambda integration.

The user sends a GET or POST request with the file name/key.

Lambda fetches the file from S3 or another source.

Reads the content and returns the output in the API response.

Typical Outputs:

JSON response with file content.

Parsed and formatted data.

Secure download link for the file.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Scheduled File Reading (EventBridge/CloudWatch Schedule)
Use case: Read files periodically (e.g., daily report processing).

How it works:
Set up a scheduled event (cron) in EventBridge.

Lambda runs on a schedule (e.g., every night at 2 AM).

Reads files from a known location (S3, EFS).

Processes data and generates output.

Typical Outputs:

Summarized report stored in S3.

Email notifications via SES.

Metrics pushed to CloudWatch or stored in a database.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Reading Large Files Using Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
Use case: File is too large for in-memory processing via S3.

How it works:
Mount EFS to your Lambda function (must run in a VPC).

Files can be directly accessed like a local file system.

Lambda reads and processes files in chunks.

Typical Outputs:

Line-by-line processing.

Log parsing, media transcoding, or large data extraction.

Output can go to another file in EFS or an external system.
